Everyone knows and loves nyaa.eu. So do I!
But how to keep track of my beloved anime releases?
I tracked the specific groups, but that was so much work.
I tracked baka-updates.com, but they miss some groups sometimes.
I tracked multiple RSS feeds from nyaa.eu, but there is no search-term combination.

Now I track it using a little chrome extension that pulls the RSS feeds for
a couple of animes, does some filtering and displays links for the next/latest
releases.

Thanks to...
